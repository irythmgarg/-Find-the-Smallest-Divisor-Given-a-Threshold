You are given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold. You need to find the smallest positive integer divisor such that the sum of all elements
in the array after dividing them by the divisor and rounding up does not exceed threshold.
For each element nums[i], the operation performed is:

Solution Explanation
Problem Requirements:

We need to minimize the divisor while ensuring the sum of the ceiling values of the divisions is within the given threshold.
Approach:

Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest divisor. The search range is from 1 to the maximum element in the array nums since dividing by a number larger than the maximum always results in 1.
Define a helper function func to check if a given divisor produces a sum less than or equal to the threshold.
Steps:

Initialize the binary search bounds: s (smallest divisor) as 1 and e (largest divisor) as max_element(nums).
For each mid-point, check using func:
If func returns true, the divisor is valid, and we move left to find a smaller valid divisor.
If false, move right to increase the divisor.
Returning the Result:

At the end of the binary search, s will point to the smallest valid divisor.
